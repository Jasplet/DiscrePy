# Welcome to discre.py. This script (or maybe module??) is for testing whether
# SKS SKKS pairs exhibit matching or discrepent splitting. This will be done
# by using the splitting measured for each phase to correct the splitting on
# the other.
### Imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import obspy as ob
import splitwavepy as sw
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Maybe some others
