# Shear_Wave_Splitting
Repository to hold scripts which I am currently developing to download seismograms, measure SKS & SKKS splitting and then test for discrepant splitting as a signal for D'' Anisotropy

## General Warning to Potential Users

This repository is primarily written for my own use. I have listed in the wiki page what some of the potentiaslly more useful programs do, but bear in mind this work is not designed for general release. There will almost certainly be bugs if you download these scripts and expect them to work without any modification
